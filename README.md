# LP2B Project : multi games in Unity

For the P23 semester at UTBM, we had to create a multi-game program with Unity through the LP2B course.

## Games available

 At any moment, in every games, you can press escape to return to the main menu.

### Apple Catcher

As it is written in the game, you can press any case to start playing. The game is limited by a timer. There are bananas, normal apples, rotten apples, golden apples and apple bombs. A banana give you more speed.  The apple bomb will be game over if it is catched. The others elements give the following points : 1, -2, 5.

### Brick Breaker

For the brick breaker, the game begins automatically and you have 3 lifes marked on the top of the game. If the ball falls off the screen, another will spawn in the middle of the screen. The goal is to go far away as you can with your lifes.

### Flappy Bird

To play Flappy Bird, you only need one key of your keyboard : the up arrow or the space key to make the bird jump. When you die, you can choose to replay the game or to go back to the menu. The goal is to pass the maximum of tunnels as you can.

## Main Menu

In the main menu, you have two possibilities : you can either click on the games' buttons to start playing a game or click to the door to leave the application.

Note : There is a .exe file in the Build folder which allows you to play without having to start Unity Editor.
