# LP2B Project : multi games in Unity

For the P23 semester at UTBM, we had to create a multi-game program with Unity through the LP2B course.

## Games available

### Apple Catcher

The goal of this game is to have as many points as possible with catching the corrects fruits.

As it is written in the game, you can press any case to start playing. The controls are simples, left arrow to go left and the right one to go right. The game is limited by a timer of 90 seconds.

There are bananas, normal apples, rotten apples, golden apples and apples bombs. A banana give you more speed to shift so it is important to pick them up.  The apple bomb will be game over if it is catched. The others elements give the following points : 1, -2, 5.

### Brick Breaker

The main objectif of this game is to have the highest score by breaking bricks and collecting coins. You can move by the left and right arrows and also by mouse mouvement.

The game begins automatically and you have 3 lifes. The first one is your first ball so don't miss it. The others are marked on the top of the screen. If the ball falls off the screen, another will spawn in the middle of the screen.

You have a 10% probability by touching a brick of spawning a coin below it. Each brick touched increases your score by 50 and each coin collected is worth 200 points.

### Flappy Bird

The goal is to pass the maximum of tunnels as you can without touching it and going out of the screen.

To play Flappy Bird, you only need one of the two keys of your keyboard to make the bird jump : the up arrow or the space key. When you die, you can choose to replay the game or to go back to the menu. 

## Main Menu

In the main menu, you have two possibilities : you can either click on the games' buttons to start playing a game or click to the door to leave the application. Once you click on a game, this will launch it and to go back, you have just to press Escape.

## Notes

At any moment, in every games, you can press Escape to return to the main menu. There is a .exe file in the Build folder which allows you to play without having to start Unity Editor.

Enjoy !
